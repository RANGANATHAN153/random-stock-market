# random-stock-market
This repository contains a data analytics project, including datasets, preprocessing, EDA, visualizations, and insights using Python.

📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing a randomly generated stock market dataset to explore trends, patterns, and insights in stock price movements over time. The dataset includes key financial metrics such as Open, High, Low, Close prices, and Trading Volume for multiple companies across different dates.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization techniques commonly used in financial data analytics.

📂 Dataset Description
Column Name	Description
Date	Trading date (YYYY-MM-DD format)
Stock	Name/Ticker of the company
Open	Stock price at the start of the trading day
High	Highest price of the day
Low	Lowest price of the day
Close	Final price of the day
Volume	Total number of shares traded

✅ The dataset is useful for:

Stock trend analysis

Time-series forecasting

Volatility and price movement studies

Machine learning model development for price prediction
